# PlaceHolders

The following placeholders are available in PetBlocks and can also be used via PlaceHolderApi.

!!! note "PlaceHolder Api"
    As PetBlocks supports multiple pets per player, you need to select the pet in your placeholders. You can do this by appending the pet slot ``_1`` ``_2`` etc. or use the ``/petblocks select <name>`` command to set a pet as selected which can be retrieved using ``_selected``.
    This results into placeholders such as e.g. ``%petblocks_pet_displayName_1%`` or ``%petblocks_pet_displayName_selected%``. This is only relevant in external plugins. For actions in PetBlocks, you can directly use the placeholders below.
